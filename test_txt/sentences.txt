Samsung has had a tough year: disappointing Galaxy S20 sales, corruption scandals and high profile internal leaks
But, for aspiring Galaxy Note 20+ owners, it just got a lot better
Samsung Galaxy Note 20 concept renderBuilding on his surprise iPhone revelations, Ross Young, CEO of Display Supply Chain Consultants, has revealed that - unlike all Galaxy S20 models - the Galaxy Note 20 design will not support a high refresh rate display
In fact, it will be limited to just 60Hz and Young says it all comes down to cost. Explaining the decision, which he states has come directly from Samsung, Young says Samsung is using LTPS (Low Temperature PolySilicon) displays in the Galaxy Note 20
These panels cannot vary their refresh rate efficiently, so battery consumption becomes a problem (as seen on the Galaxy S20 phones) and a huge battery is needed to counteract it. The good news is Young states that an LTPO (Low Temperature Polysilicon Oxide) panel will be used in the Galaxy Note 20+ and this supports refresh rates from 1-120Hz
This means the flagship Note not only supports 120Hz, but it can be extremely efficient by slowing the refresh right down when it is not needed
This could be a game-changer, especially with 120Hz support for the iPhone 12 Pro now in doubt. 05/13 Update: Young has added further information to Samsung's 2020 smartphone display plans, confirming that Samsung will use the 120Hz LTPO panels from the Galaxy Note 20+ in its next generation Galaxy Fold 2
Young states that in July Samsung will clear out existing Galaxy Fold stock with a fire-sale price of $1,099 (almost half its original $2,000 cost) ahead of the Fold 2 launch (tipped for October)
Samsung will rebrand the cut-price Fold 1 as the 'Galaxy Fold Special Edition' but Young warns that there will be nothing special about it other than the reduced price
Given the 120Hz omission from the Galaxy Note 20, this might just give Note fans an alternative and unexpected big-screen smartphone option

That said, with Samsung pricing the standard Galaxy Note 10 at $950 last year and the Note 10+ at $1,100, the entry-level Note 20 still looks set to be 50% more expensive than the new entry-level iPhone 12
As such, it is the Galaxy Note 20+ which looks set to be the Samsung smartphone to beat
