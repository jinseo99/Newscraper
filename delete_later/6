Music licensing company Rumblefish last week announced a new music program for YouTube users, enabling them to buy a lifetime, worldwide music license on a selected music track at $1.99 a pop and fully edit the music into their videos.

The online store, dubbed Friendly Music, has just been pushed live.

YouTube users can use the website to access Rumblefish’s catalog of copyright-cleared songs (about 35,000 tracks strong), which they can use to create soundtracks for their videos.

As I mentioned, songs can be purchased from the Friendly Music site at $1.99 per video, and users can edit them using which video-editing application they prefer. Buyers receive an official license for every song they use, so when they upload their finished video to YouTube they can be confident it will not be blocked or deprived of its audio.

FriendlyMusic offers royalty-free songs by artists in styles ranging from rap, reggae and R&B to country, pop and techno, as well as full orchestral recordings of classical compositions.

New music is said to be added to the catalog on a daily basis, and in the coming months the company says the Friendly Music catalog will expand to include “handpicked collections of name artists”.
